# Code-Quiz

## About

This application serves a basic quiz on coding topics! The purpose is to ask the user a series of questions, and display a series of multiple choices for possible answers. The user will select from the possible answers, and will be added to the user's score or deducted from the time remaining based on response. After all questions are answered or there is no time remaining, whichever comes first, the quiz will display the user's score and prompt the user to enter their initials. These will be collected in local storage, and the user will be booted to the high scores page. This page will pull high scores from local storage, and display in an ordered list, in order of highest score to lowest.
